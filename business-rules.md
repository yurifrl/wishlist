Business Rules
--------------

### 1. Introduction
[The introduction of the Business Rules should
provide an overview of the entire document.  Present any information the reader might need to
understand the document in this section. This document is used to define terminology specific to the
problem domain, explaining terms which may be unfamiliar to the reader of the use-case descriptions
or other project documents.  Often, this document can be used as an informal data dictionary,
capturing data definitions so that use-case descriptions and other project documents can focus on
what the system must do with the information.  This document should be saved in a file called
Business Rules.]

#### 1.1 Purpose
[Specify the purpose of this document.]

#### 1.2 Scope
[A brief description of the scope of this Business Rules
document; what Project(s) it is associated with, and anything else that is affected or influenced by
this document.]

#### 1.3 References
[This subsection should provide a complete list of all
documents referenced elsewhere in the Business Rules document.  Each document should be identified
by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization.  Specify the sources
from which the references can be obtained. This information may be provided by reference to an
appendix or to another document.]

#### 1.4 Overview
[This subsection should describe what the rest of the
Business Rules document contains and explain how the document is organized.]

### 2. Definitions
[The terms defined here form the essential substance
of the document.  They can be defined in any order desired, but generally alphabetic order provides
the greatest accessibility.]

#### 2.1 <aBusinessRule>
[The definition for <aBusinessRule> is presented here, with as much information as the reader needs
[to understand the concept.]

#### 2.2 <anotherBusinessRule>
[The definition for <anotherBusinessRule> is presented here, with as
much information as the reader needs to understand the concept.]

#### 2.3 <aGroupofBusinessRules>
[Sometimes it is useful to organize Business Rules into groups to
improve readability.  For example, if the problem domain contains Business Rules related to both
accounting and building construction (as would be the case if we were developing a system to manage
construction projects), presenting the Business Rules from the two different sub-domains might prove
confusing to the reader.  To solve this problem, we use groupings of Business Rules.  In presenting
the grouping of Business Rules, provide a short description that helps the reader understand what
<aGroupOfBusinessRules> represents.  Business Rules presented within the group should be organized
alphabetically for easy access.]

##### 2.3.1 <aGroupBusinessRule>
[The definition for <aGroupBusinessRule> is presented here, with as
much information as the reader needs to understand the concept.]

##### 2.3.2 <anotherGroupBusinessRule>
