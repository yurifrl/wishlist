2.    Positioning <a name="#positioning"></a>

2.1 Business Opportunity

[Briefly describe the business opportunity being met by this project.]

2.2 Problem Statement

[Provide a statement summarizing the problem being solved by this project. The following format may be used:]

| The problem of | [describe the problem] |
| affects | [who are the stakeholders affected by the problem?] |
| the impact of which is | [what is the impact of the problem?] |
| a successful solution would be | [list some key benefits of a successful solution] |

| The (product name) | is a [product category] |
| That | [statement of key benefit; that is, what is the compelling reason to buy?] |
| Unlike | [primary competitive alternative] |
| Our product | [statement of primary differentiation] |

[A product position statement communicates the intent of the application and the importance of the project to all concerned personnel.]

3.    Stakeholder and Customer Descriptions

[To effectively provide products and services that meet your stakeholders’ and users' real needs, it is necessary to identify and involve all of the stakeholders as part of the Business Modeling process.  You must also identify the users of the system and ensure that the stakeholder community adequately represents them.  This section provides a profile of the stakeholders and users involved in the project and the key problems that they perceive to be addressed by the proposed solution.  It does not describe their specific requests or requirements as these are captured in a separate stakeholder requests artifact.  Instead it provides the background and justification for why the requirements are needed.]

3.1 Market Demographics

[Summarize the key market demographics that motivate your product decisions. Describe and position target market segments. Estimate the market’s size and growth by using the number of potential users, or the amount of money your customers spend trying to meet needs that your product or enhancement would fulfill. Review major industry trends and technologies. Answer these strategic questions:

• What is your organization’s reputation in these markets?

• What would you like it to be?

• How does this product or service support your goals?]

3.2 Stakeholder Summary

[There are a number of stakeholders with an interest in the development and not all of them are end users. Present a summary list of these non-user stakeholders. (The users are summarized in section 3.3.)]

| Name | Description | Responsibilities |
| [Name the stakeholder type.] | [Briefly describe the stakeholder.] | [Summarize the stakeholder's key responsibilities with regard to the system being developed; that is, their interest as a stakeholder. For example, this stakeholder:- ensures that the system will be maintainable- ensures that there will be a market demand for the product's features- monitors the project's progress - approves funding- and so forth] |

3.3 Customer Summary

[Present a summary list of all identified users.]

| Name | Description | Responsibilities | Stakeholder |
|:---------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Name the user type.] | [Briefly describe what they represent with respect to the system.] | [List the user's key responsibilities with regard to the system being developed; for example:- captures details- produces reports- coordinates work- and so on] | [If the user is not directly represented, identify which stakeholder is responsible for representing the user's interests.] |
 

3.4 Customer Environment

[Detail the working environment of the target user. Here are some suggestions:

Number of people involved in completing the task? Is this changing?

How long is a task cycle? Amount of time spent in each activity? Is this changing?

Any unique environmental constraints: mobile, outdoors, in-flight, and so on.?

Which systems platforms are in use today? Future platforms?

What other applications are in use? Does your application need to integrate with them?

This is where extracts from the Business Model could be included to outline the task and business workers involved, and so on.]

3.5 Stakeholder Profiles 

[Describe each stakeholder in the system here by filling in the following table for each stakeholder. Remember that stakeholder types can be as divergent as users, departments, and technical developers. A thorough profile would cover the following topics for each type of stakeholder.]

3.5.1 <Stakeholder Name>
Representative

[Who is the stakeholder representative to the project?  (This is optional if documented elsewhere.)  What we want here is names.]

Description

[Brief description of the stakeholder type.]

Type

[Qualify the stakeholder’s expertise, technical background, and degree of sophistication—that is, guru, business, expert, casual user, and so on.]

Responsibilities

[List the stakeholder’s key responsibilities with regard to the system being developed—that is, their interest as a stakeholder.]

Success Criteria

[How does the stakeholder define success?

How is the stakeholder rewarded?]

Involvement

[How is the stakeholder involved in the project? Relate where possible to the Rational Unified Process roles—that is, Requirements Reviewer, and so on.]

Deliverables

[Are there any additional deliverables required by the stakeholder?  These could be project deliverables or outputs from the system under development.]

Comments / Issues

[Problems that interfere with success and any other relevant information go here.]

3.6 Customer Profiles 

[Describe each unique user of the system here by filling in the following table for each customer type.  A thorough profile covers the following topics for each type of user:]

3.6.1 <Customer Name>
Representative

[Who is the user representative to the project?  (This is optional if documented elsewhere.)  This often refers to the Stakeholder that represents the set of users; for example, Stakeholder: Stakeholder1.]

Description

[A brief description of the customer type.]

Type

[Qualify the customer’s expertise, technical background, and degree of sophistication—that is, guru, casual user, and so on.]

Responsibilities

[List the user’s key responsibilities with regards to the system being developed— that is, captures customers details, produces reports, coordinates work, and so on.]

Success Criteria

[How does the customer define success?

 How is the customer rewarded?]

Involvement

[How the customer is involved in the project? Relate where possible to the Rational Unified Process roles—that is, Requirements Reviewer, and so on.]

Deliverables

[Are there any deliverables the customer produces and, if so, for whom?]

Comments / Issues

[Problems that interfere with success and any other relevant information go here.

These include trends that make the customer’s job easier or more difficult.]

3.7 Key Stakeholder or Customer Needs

[List the key problems with existing solutions as perceived by the stakeholder. Clarify the following issues for each problem:

• What are the reasons for this problem?

• How is it solved now?

• What solutions does the user want?]

[It is important to understand the relative importance the stakeholder places on solving each problem. Ranking and cumulative voting techniques indicate problems that must be solved versus issues they would like addressed.

Fill in the following table—if using Rational RequisitePro to capture the Needs, this could be an extract or report from that tool.]

Need

Priority

Concerns

Current Solution

Proposed Solutions

Broadcast messages

    
3.8 Alternatives and Competition

[Identify alternatives the stakeholder perceives as available. These can include buying a competitor’s product, building a homegrown solution or simply maintaining the status quo.
